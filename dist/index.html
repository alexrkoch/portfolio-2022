            <strong>Description: </strong>This app can be used to create and
            then follow processes that have steps. It allows for 2 different
            kinds of users: Editors and Followers. Editors can create and edit
            processes, define steps of those processes which can be answered as
            free text, multiple choice, or boolean. Followers can then "follow"
            and complete any of the processes. Tokens were used to identify each
            "following", and a record of the complete or incomplete followings
            can be accessed by the Editor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The majority of the app was developed with rigorous Test Driven
            Development on both front and back end.

            <strong>Problem: </strong>A hypothetical user is feeling nostalgic
            and wants to peruse movies in a random order selecting only the year
            and genre. Also, I needed practice writing Javascript, working with
            an API, and working on a collaborative team.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Action: </strong>I teamed up with two other code academy
            students (one back-end and one front-end, I was primarily front-end)
            to build a web app using vanilla JS on the front end with SCSS &
            BEM. The back-end is Node/Express, and is hosted on Heroku.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Result: </strong>The Reels movie app has a simple UI
            designed mobile-first, and faithfully returns a random list of
            movies from the selected year and genre for the user to flip
            through. Our team practiced using a Kanban board, and collaborating
            on GitHub.

            <strong>Problem: </strong>I needed a website to showcase my
            r&eacutesum&eacute and portfolio, and keep them up to date for the
            next time I'm on the job hunt! Also, now that I'm working almost
            exclusively in modern front end frameworks, its nice to practice a
            "vanilla" website with just HTML and SCSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Action: </strong>Create a simple, lightweight static web
            page with basic technologies. I used SCSS for a maintainable and
            symanic styling system. I also designed this page with some (I
            think) elegant and modern colors, font, and link transitions. I
            followed basic design best practices for spacing, padding, margin,
            etc. The site is not currently mobile responsive, but its on my
            to-do when I have some time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Result: </strong>You tell me, do you like this site? It's
            the one you're on right NOW! I think its fit for purpose, and doing
            what I want it to. It's fun to get back to basics while maintaining
            the site, and its accessible to anyone considering me for a job.

            <strong>Problem: </strong>The Moose Club, a fictitious fan club for
            my precious son, Moose the dog, needed a website for their
            organization. Their requirements were; A menu header with links to
            the various sections of the site, a large photo hero banner at the
            top, a short "About us" blurb, and a gallery of photos of their
            beloved Moose. The site needed to be mobile responsive. This was an
            exercise I made up to practice basic HTML and CSS with a responsive
            layout.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Action: </strong>I created this website using semantic HTML
            and SCSS & BEM to produce a maintainable stylesheet. I used media
            queries to make the webpage responsive. I also compressed the photos
            for a faster loading page.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Result: </strong>The Moose Club now has the code for a
            beautiful and responsive website with a lightweight footprint.

            <strong>Problem: </strong>I was applying to a job that was a
            geoscience-focused developer job. The owner of the firm let me know
            that they worked heavily with Python, CI/CD, and Docker. I had
            plenty of Python experience, but had never worked with CI/CD and
            Docker.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Action: </strong> I conceived a fake groundwater flow
            direction problem to flex my geoscience knowledge, while giving me a
            chance to develop the new skillsets needed for the job interview. I
            created a docker image that would run my Python tool in the command
            line and calculate the groundwater flow direction based on input
            measurements. I set up a CICD pipeline using Github Actions, which
            would build my docker image, run my unit tests, and if all was
            successful push the updated image to Docker Hub.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Result: </strong>I created a functional command line tool
            which calculates groundwater flow direction from 3 points of data. I
            got great feedback on this project during the interview, but
            unfortunately didn't get the position (cest la vie!)

            <strong>Problem: </strong>Ever since becoming a Love Island fan a
            few years ago, I've wanted to do a data project similar to what
            <a
              class="inline-link"
              target="_blank"
              href="https://www.instagram.com/bachelordata/"
              >@Bachelordata</a
            >
            does for the Bachelor Franchise. Ultimately my attempts have failed
            because collecting data on the show ruins my viewing experience,
            which I cherish so much. Part of that was due to the experience of
            collecting data- just typing it into a spreadsheet. I needed a
            quick, ergonomic, and convenient way to capture data on my tablet
            while watching the show from my couch.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Action: </strong>At the time I made this, I was making
            WordPress websites as a freelancer, so I chose WordPress as my tool
            to make this app to strengthen skills that were relevant to me at
            the time. I used Bootstrap to layout the UI of the app, and PHP and
            SQL to create, read, and delete from the database.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Result: </strong>I used the app to record detailed data from
            about 10 episodes of Love Island Australia Season 3 before I decided
            yet again that it was too much work for a side project, and just
            continued to watch without collecting data. The app has a clean and
            intuitive data collection structure, and is easy to use from a
            tablet while watching the show. All intended database operations
            work for the action and islander data.

            <strong>Problem: </strong> The Wake County Housing Justice
            Coalition, a local housing activist group that I have done some work
            with, needed a website to share information about their
            organization, write blog posts, take contacts from the community,
            manage upcoming events and volunteer registration, and display a
            twitter stream in the side bar. They had no major requirements on
            design but asked for something simple that aligned with their color
            theme.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Action: </strong> I created a WordPress website for them
            using a Bootstrap-based theme. I customized the theme to fit their
            needs, and added an events plugin to help with the volunteer
            registration and event management, which required a bit of PHP
            customization. I also re-worked their logo to be more web-friendly.
            I set them up with their own Bluehost account and launched the
            website for them..
