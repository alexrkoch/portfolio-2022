            Designed and developed WordPress websites for a variety of different

          <p class="resume-item__description">
            My role with Chevron was to perform geological assessments of the
            subsurface, including geometry and sedimentology of reservoir rock
            units, and volume, distribution, and temperature of the oil
            contained within them. I assessed risk and uncertainty associated
            with drilling oil wells to inform many aspects of project design and
            decision-making. To accomplish these subsurface assessments I used
            large datasets of petrophysical well log data from existing oil
            wells in the area, including both dynamic temporal data as well as
            static data. In total I planned 167 wells and was involved in the
            execution of 140 wells as either a point-of-contact for the drilling
            rig or directly as the on-call geologist. Most aspects of this role
            were cross-disciplinary in nature, working closely with project
            managers, reservoir engineers, drilling engineers, facilities
            engineers, and various subject matter experts in addition to my
            fellow geologists.

            <strong>Problem: </strong>A hypothetical user is feeling nostalgic
            and wants to peruse movies in a random order selecting only the year
            and genre. Also, I needed practice writing Javascript, working with
            an API, and working on a collaborative team.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Action: </strong>I teamed up with two other code academy
            students (one back-end and one front-end, I was primarily front-end)
            to build a web app using vanilla JS on the front end with SCSS &
            BEM. The back-end is Node/Express, and is hosted on Heroku.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Result: </strong>The Reels movie app has a simple UI
            designed mobile-first, and faithfully returns a random list of
            movies from the selected year and genre for the user to flip
            through. Our team practiced using a Kanban board, and collaborating
            on GitHub.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Tech: </strong>Javascript, Asynchronous JS, using API data
            from JSON, HTML, CSS (SCSS & BEM), Node.js, Express.js, Github,
            Heroku.

            <strong>Problem: </strong>Ever since becoming a Love Island fan a
            few years ago, I've wanted to do a data project similar to what
            <a
              class="inline-link"
              target="_blank"
              href="https://www.instagram.com/bachelordata/"
              >@Bachelordata</a
            >
            does for the Bachelor Franchise. Ultimately my attempts have failed
            because collecting data on the show ruins my viewing experience,
            which I cherish so much. Part of that was due to the experience of
            collecting data- just typing it into a spreadsheet. I needed a
            quick, ergonomic, and convenient way to capture data on my tablet
            while watching the show from my couch.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Action: </strong>At the time I made this, I was making
            WordPress websites as a freelancer, so I chose WordPress as my tool
            to make this app to strengthen skills that were relevant to me at
            the time. I used Bootstrap to layout the UI of the app, and PHP and
            SQL to create, read, and delete from the database.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Result: </strong>I used the app to record detailed data from
            about 10 episodes of Love Island Australia Season 3 before I decided
            yet again that it was too much work for a side project, and just
            continued to watch without collecting data. The app has a clean and
            intuitive data collection structure, and is easy to use from a
            tablet while watching the show. All intended database operations
            work for the action and islander data.
          </p>

            <strong>Problem: </strong>The Moose Club, a fictitious fan club for
            my precious son, Moose the dog, needed a website for their
            organization. Their requirements were; A menu header with links to
            the various sections of the site, a large photo hero banner at the
            top, a short "About us" blurb, and a gallery of photos of their
            beloved Moose. The site needed to be mobile responsive. This was an
            exercise I made up to practice basic HTML and CSS with a responsive
            layout.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Action: </strong>I created this website using semantic HTML
            and SCSS & BEM to produce a maintainable stylesheet. I used media
            queries to make the webpage responsive. I also compressed the photos
            for a faster loading page.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Result: </strong>The Moose Club now has the code for a
            beautiful and responsive website with a lightweight footprint.
